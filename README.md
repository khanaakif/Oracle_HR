# Oracle Employee Database Project


This project explores the Oracle Employee Database, focusing on the details record and its related data tables. The database schema comprises six tables: countries, departments, dependents, jobs, locations, regions, and employees. The entity relationship diagram below illustrates the connections between these tables, with the employees table serving as the parent table linked to the other entities.
## Table Structure
The database includes the following tables:

1. countries: Contains information about different countries.

2. departments: Stores data related to various departments within the company.

3. dependents: Holds details about the dependents of employees.

4. jobs: Contains job-related information such as job titles and descriptions.

5. locations: Store details about different company locations.

6. regions: Contains information about geographical regions.

7. employees: The main table that stores employee details acts as the parent table for the other entities.

## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze the Oracle Employee Database and understand how the various data tables collaborate with the main employee table. By exploring the relationships and data within the database, we can gain insights into the company's organizational structure, job roles, employee locations, dependent information, and more.
